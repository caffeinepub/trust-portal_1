# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Remove the English subtitle line "Service is the highest duty" from the founder section on the Home page.

**Planned changes:**
- Delete the English translation line "Service is the highest duty" from the founder section in `frontend/src/pages/Home.tsx`, keeping only the Hindi motto "मानव सेवा परमो धर्मः".

**User-visible outcome:** The founder section on the Home page will display only the Hindi motto, with no English translation line below it.
