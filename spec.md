# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Replace the existing 3 book cover images with 4 newly uploaded real book cover photos and update the books section on both the Home and About pages to show all 4 books.

**Planned changes:**
- Save the 4 uploaded book cover photos as static assets: `book-cover-01.jpeg` (गंगा की वाणी), `book-cover-02.jpeg` (मन के मोती), `book-cover-03.jpeg` (श्री कृष्ण दर्शन), and `book-cover-04.jpeg` (वृद्धाश्रम)
- Update the "Books by Our Founder" section on the Home page to display 4 book cards using the new cover images with correct Hindi titles
- Update the "Books by Our Founder" section on the About page to display 4 book cards using the new cover images with correct Hindi titles

**User-visible outcome:** The books section on both the Home and About pages shows all 4 real book covers — गंगा की वाणी, मन के मोती, श्री कृष्ण दर्शन, and वृद्धाश्रम — in a responsive layout.
