  "summary": "The diff modifies frontend/src/pages/Gallery.tsx, but instead of removing gallery-photo-28.jpeg, gallery-photo-29.jpeg, and gallery-photo-30.jpeg from a hardcoded array of gallery-photo-01.jpeg through gallery-photo-30.jpeg, the implementation shows a completely different static photo array using WhatsApp-named image files with 33 entries (static-1 through static-33). The file summary confirms '33 static WhatsApp activity photos (static-1 through static-33, with PHOTO0.jpeg, PHOTO0-1.jpeg, and PHOTO0-2.jpeg removed)'. The spirit of the requirement to remove the last 3 static photos does not appear to be implemented, as the array still contains 33 entries.",

      "reason": "The diff shows the Gallery.tsx static photos array uses WhatsApp-named filenames rather than gallery-photo-XX.jpeg naming, and still contains 33 entries (static-1 through static-33). No photos were removed from the static array; the count was not reduced by 3 as required.",
