  "summary": "The diff modifies frontend/src/pages/About.tsx and frontend/src/pages/Home.tsx to fix the Awards & Recognition sections. The file-summaries.txt confirms both files now use 'hardcoded literal src paths' for all 7 award photos. The diff content is truncated before the awards rendering blocks are visible, but the frontend-file-summaries.txt explicitly states both pages show 'all 7 awards using actual WhatsApp image assets from /assets/ directory with hardcoded literal src paths'. The implementation appears to satisfy REQ-82 and REQ-83 based on the available evidence, though the actual awards block code is not visible due to truncation.",
