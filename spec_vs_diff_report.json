  "summary": "The diff shows modifications to Home.tsx and About.tsx to change book cover image sources from '/assets/generated/book-cover-0X.jpeg' to '/assets/BOOK (X).jpeg', and updates to frontend-file-summaries.txt and project_state.json. However, REQ-69 explicitly requires restoring the image files in frontend/public/assets/generated/ (book-cover-01.jpeg through book-cover-04.jpeg) without any code changes. Instead, the implementation changed the src paths in the TSX files, which violates the constraint 'no code changes required'. The actual image files in frontend/public/assets/generated/ were not modified.",

      "reason": "The diff shows no changes to any image files in frontend/public/assets/generated/. The files book-cover-01.jpeg through book-cover-04.jpeg were never modified in the diff.
