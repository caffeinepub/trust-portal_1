  "summary": "The diff modifies Home.tsx and About.tsx to display 4 book cards with correct titles and paths for books 1-3 (using /assets/generated/book-cover-0X.jpeg), but uses '/assets/BOOK (4).jpeg' for the 4th book instead of '/assets/generated/book-cover-04.jpeg'. No new static asset files are added in the diff (the ADDED FILES section shows none), meaning the actual image files are not stored in frontend/public/assets/generated/ as required.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-66",
      "requirement": "Store the 4 newly uploaded book cover photos as static assets in frontend/public/assets/generated/ with filenames book-cover-01.jpeg, book-cover-02.jpeg, book-cover-03.jpeg, and book-cover-04.jpeg.",
      "reason": "The diff shows no added files (ADDED FILES: none). The image assets themselves are not present in the diff. Additionally, book-cover-04.jpeg is not stored at /assets/generated/book-cover-04.jpeg — both Home.tsx and About.tsx reference '/assets/BOOK (4).jpeg' instead of '/assets/generated/book-cover-04.jpeg'.",
