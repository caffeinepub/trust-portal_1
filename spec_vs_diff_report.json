The About page (frontend/src/pages/About.tsx) now displays 'Teacher, Writer and Social Worker' as an italic subtitle beneath 'Anjani Dwivedi (Kavya)', and the Home page (frontend/src/pages/Home.tsx) does the same in the founder section. The motto text and founder photo remain unchanged on the Home page. No files under frontend/src/hooks/ or frontend/src/components/ui/ were modified.",
